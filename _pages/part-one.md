     Naomi works as one of five training specialists on the Learning and Development (L&D) team at a manufacturing company. With a manufacturing background, Naomi previously held roles such as Lean Coach and Quality Control Specialist before joining the L&D team.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     In her current role, which she has held for a year and a half, Naomi is responsible for coordinating and facilitating training for the company's logistics teams. She is interested in applying for a newly opened position in her department: Associate Instructional Designer.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     Over the past year and a half, Naomi has gained experience using various content creation tools, including Rise360, Storyline, Camtasia, Vyond, and Canva. She is also familiar with the instructional design framework used by her team, having participated in several discovery calls and training effectiveness reviews.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     One of Naomi's long-term goals is to earn an advanced degree in Instructional Design. She believes this would provide her with the foundational knowledge and insights she needs to excel in her current role and future opportunities, whether or not she secures the Associate Instructional Designer position. Her strong manufacturing background, combined with a degree in Instructional Design, would enhance her contributions to the L&D team.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     Naomi is also certified as a Lean Six Sigma Black Belt, a credential she earned in her previous role in the Quality department from State’s University. She was pleased to discover that the same university offers a Master’s degree in Instructional Design, making it one of her top choices for further education. The part-time program would allow her to continue working while pursuing her studies, which is particularly appealing.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     While preparing her application for the program, Naomi learned that applicants are strongly encouraged to submit a portfolio showcasing relevant work. Although she has created smaller pieces of content, such as microlearnings and guides, she is unfamiliar with platforms for creating and sharing instructional design portfolios. She doesn’t believe her current employer uses a platform for this purpose, so she plans to research her options and consult with the Instructional Design team for suggestions.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     Naomi has six months before the application deadline, giving her ample time to research, potentially learn a new tool, and create her portfolio. With a full-time job and a one-year-old baby, she needs a platform or service that is easy to use, affordable, and manageable. Hiring a professional to develop a website for her portfolio is not a viable option due to cost and her desire to be hands-on throughout the process.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     Naomi uses a Windows laptop at work and a MacBook at home. She has 3 to 5 examples of work in different formats—such as SCORM files, PNG and JPEG graphics, and MP4 videos—that she plans to include in her portfolio. She is also considering adding a copy of her resume to showcase her extensive manufacturing experience. If she completes her portfolio in time, she may use it to apply for the internal Associate Instructional Designer position as well.

     Victoria is a PhD student in urban planning at State’s University. She started her program last summer. Prior to that, she worked as a consultant for an urban planning firm in her native France.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     During her time as a consultant, Victoria participated in and eventually led several urban planning projects across the globe. In her final year as a consultant, she traveled to over 25 cities across four continents, either for projects or professional events. During these travels, Victoria documented her reflections, lessons learned, and ideas in numerous notes, which she has saved on her MacBook M3 Pro.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     Although she no longer travels for work, Victoria has been involved in field trips and other research activities as part of her PhD program at State’s University. She continues to capture her reflections in her notes.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     Since starting her PhD, Victoria has also adopted new tools for her note-taking, such as knowledge management principles to structure her research, and software like Obsidian to create templates and organize her notes into categories. This approach has enabled her to manage and visualize all her notes—whether from her professional career, PhD research, or personal life—in one centralized place.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     One of the challenges she faced while learning how to use knowledge management tools like Obsidian was learning the Markdown (.md) syntax used to store content in the notes. However, after converting a few of her old Microsoft Word notes into the new format, she quickly became comfortable with it. Victoria now believes that the benefits of centralizing her notes far outweigh the initial learning curve.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     Now three months into her PhD program, with at least four more years before graduation, Victoria has been thinking about ways to remain relevant in the urban planning field. She understands the importance of staying active on social media to maintain her professional network, but she’s also considering another channel to share the content she has been creating in her notes over the years—something like a blog. Ideally, she wants a platform she can fully control and manage, giving her freedom from social media algorithms and regulations.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     She is considering starting her own blog but hasn’t yet decided how to proceed or which platform to use.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     Although content management platforms exist for this purpose, their subscription models and pricing options are something she wants to avoid—especially since more customization often comes with higher costs, which could add up significantly over the remaining four years of her studies.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     Her current alternative is to develop and host her own site. This prospect excites her, but she acknowledges that it’s an area where she has little to no practical experience. While trying to learn on her own, Victoria has found plenty of resources, but none that offer a cohesive, structured approach tailored to her specific needs.

     Jordan is an industrial engineer currently studying cloud computing at State’s University. Most of his professional experience comes from working on projects in the vehicle manufacturing industry, but he is eager to break into the tech industry. To get started, he decided to take a few courses focused on tech, particularly in cloud computing. He began with a basic Python programming course at State’s University, and after having a positive experience that aligned with his goals, he enrolled in the Cloud Computing Fundamentals course he's currently taking. Once he finishes, Jordan plans to take an advanced Python course before applying for his first tech role.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     Jordan is well aware of the tech industry's reputation for having rigorous hiring processes. He’s heard from peers in his classes that many employers ask for portfolios showcasing applied tech skills.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     So far, Jordan has developed a few solutions in his programming courses and is working on a larger project as part of his Cloud Computing Fundamentals course. He’s eager to showcase these in his portfolio but hasn't yet decided which platform or tools to use.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     While he has some basic familiarity with websites, Jordan has not taken any formal web development courses. Most of his work is stored in a GitHub repository, so he wants a portfolio solution that is compatible with GitHub or can easily integrate his work. He also wants enough freedom to customize the portfolio to his liking. One key priority for Jordan is using his own personalized domain, as he believes it will make his portfolio appear more professional.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     He knows platforms like Wix, WordPress, and Squarespace offer content management and hosting services, but he estimates these could cost up to $200 per year, which he’s hesitant to spend.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     Jordan has heard that GitHub offers free hosting for static websites, but he’s not entirely sure what a static site is or how to get started. He feels there’s a lack of structured information to help him evaluate this option and begin building his site.

      Business Need/Problem Statement:
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     Multiple students across different programs at State University (PhD, Industrial Engineering, Instructional Design) need to create professional web portfolios/sites. These students lack structured guidance on building static websites despite having technical capabilities. The university's current curriculum doesn't address this common need, and students are seeking costly alternatives (e.g. Wix, Squarespace, WordPress) or struggling to find cohesive resources, which could impact their academic success and professional transitions.
