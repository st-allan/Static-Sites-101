      A static site or static page is a type of website that consists of fixed content—typically simple HTML, CSS, and media files (e.g., images, audio, and video)—delivered to the user exactly as it is stored on the server. This content does not change and cannot be modified by viewers, hence the term "static."

      For example, a simple blog with text and images is static, while an e-commerce or social media site, where users can alter available stock or create and display posts, is dynamic.
