    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
      State University offers an extensive catalog of courses, classes, and certifications across a wide range of disciplines, from engineering to social sciences. Its student and professional population is highly diverse. 
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
    The following personas will provide insights into this diversity and serve as an introduction to the project's problem statement.

     Naomi works as one of five training specialists on the Learning and Development (L&D) team at a manufacturing company. With a manufacturing background, Naomi previously held roles such as Lean Coach and Quality Control Specialist before joining the L&D team.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     In her current role, which she has held for a year and a half, Naomi is responsible for coordinating and facilitating training for the company's logistics teams. She is interested in applying for a newly opened position in her department: Associate Instructional Designer.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     Over the past year and a half, Naomi has gained experience using various content creation tools, including Rise360, Storyline, Camtasia, Vyond, and Canva. She is also familiar with the instructional design framework used by her team, having participated in several discovery calls and training effectiveness reviews.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     One of Naomi's long-term goals is to earn an advanced degree in Instructional Design. She believes this would provide her with the foundational knowledge and insights she needs to excel in her current role and future opportunities, whether or not she secures the Associate Instructional Designer position. Her strong manufacturing background, combined with a degree in Instructional Design, would enhance her contributions to the L&D team.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     Naomi is also certified as a Lean Six Sigma Black Belt, a credential she earned in her previous role in the Quality department from State’s University. She was pleased to discover that the same university offers a Master’s degree in Instructional Design, making it one of her top choices for further education. The part-time program would allow her to continue working while pursuing her studies, which is particularly appealing.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     While preparing her application for the program, Naomi learned that applicants are strongly encouraged to submit a portfolio showcasing relevant work. Although she has created smaller pieces of content, such as microlearnings and guides, she is unfamiliar with platforms for creating and sharing instructional design portfolios. She doesn’t believe her current employer uses a platform for this purpose, so she plans to research her options and consult with the Instructional Design team for suggestions.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     Naomi has six months before the application deadline, giving her ample time to research, potentially learn a new tool, and create her portfolio. With a full-time job and a one-year-old baby, she needs a platform or service that is easy to use, affordable, and manageable. Hiring a professional to develop a website for her portfolio is not a viable option due to cost and her desire to be hands-on throughout the process.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-l lh-copy">
     Naomi uses a Windows laptop at work and a MacBook at home. She has 3 to 5 examples of work in different formats—such as SCORM files, PNG and JPEG graphics, and MP4 videos—that she plans to include in her portfolio. She is also considering adding a copy of her resume to showcase her extensive manufacturing experience. If she completes her portfolio in time, she may use it to apply for the internal Associate Instructional Designer position as well.
